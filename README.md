The aim of the Open ELIoT project is the implementation of an integrated and economically viable Internet of Things solution for monitoring and analyzing environmental parameters with regard to surface water. The solution extends from sensors (data acquisition) to the online data processing and analysis platform, which follows an “open” architecture / approach.

This is the code repository for the backend and frontend application that backs this platform.
